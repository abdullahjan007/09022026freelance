 5. THIRD-PARTY DISCLOSURES AND AI TRAINING  
We do not sell, lease, rent, or otherwise disclose personal data to third parties for advertising, marketing, or commercial purposes. User inputs are not used to train third-party artificial intelligence models.

Where required by applicable law (e.g., GDPR Article 22), explicit prior consent will be obtained for any processing involving automated decision-making.

 6. REGION-SPECIFIC LEGAL COMPLIANCE

 6.1 European Economic Area (GDPR)  
Processing is based on Article 6(1)(b) (performance of a contract) and Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests). Data subjects retain rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection. Requests shall be submitted to the contact specified in Section 11.

 6.2 India (Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023)  
TeacherBuddy acts as a Data Fiduciary under the DPDPA. Consent is obtained at the point of account creation. Cross-border transfers of personal data comply with Chapter V of the DPDPA and occur only to jurisdictions ensuring adequate data protection standards.

 6.3 United States  
The platform complies with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The service is not directed toward individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

 7. MINORS AND PARENTAL CONSENT  
TeacherBuddy is not intended for use by individuals under the age of eighteen (18). The platform does not solicit, collect, or process personal data from minors, directly or indirectly. In the event that a minor accesses the platform through a shared device, no persistent identifiers or account data are created, and session data is automatically purged within twenty-four (24) hours. No parental consent mechanism is implemented, as the service falls outside the scope of COPPA and analogous provisions under the DPDPA due to its exclusive targeting of adult professionals.
