 Report Abuse Policy  
Effective Date: January 14, 2026  

TeacherBuddy is committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and professional environment for educators. While the platform is designed for constructive educational use, we recognize that misuse may occur. This policy outlines how to report abusive, illegal, or inappropriate content or behaviour—and how we respond.

 1. What Constitutes Abuse?  
You may report content or conduct that:  
- Violates applicable laws (e.g., defamation, harassment, copyright infringement);  
- Contains hate speech, threats, or discriminatory language;  
- Attempts to impersonate another individual or institution;  
- Involves unauthorised sharing of confidential or sensitive information;  
- Exploits the platform for spam, phishing, or malicious activity;  
- Otherwise breaches our [Terms of Use]() or professional standards.

Note: TeacherBuddy does not host user-to-user communication or public content feeds. Most inputs are private and ephemeral. Reports typically relate to AI-generated outputs that inadvertently produce harmful, biased, or inaccurate material.

 2. How to Report  
To submit a report:  
1. Email graderelite@gmail.com with the subject line: “Abuse Report – [Brief Description]”  
2. Include:  
   - Your name and registered email address (if applicable);  
   - Date and time of the incident;  
   - Description of the issue;  
   - Screenshots or copied text (if available);  
   - Any other relevant context.

All reports are treated as confidential and reviewed promptly.

 3. Our Response Process  
Upon receipt of a valid report, we will:  
- Acknowledge your submission within 48 hours;  
- Investigate the matter in good faith;  
- Take appropriate action, which may include:  
  - Removing or blocking problematic content;  
  - Disabling accounts involved in malicious activity;  
  - Refining AI safeguards to prevent recurrence;  
  - Reporting illegal activity to relevant authorities where required by law.

We do not mediate interpersonal disputes unrelated to platform misuse.

 4. False or Frivolous Reports  
Knowingly submitting false or vexatious reports may result in restriction of your access to the platform. Abuse reporting mechanisms must be used in good faith.

 5. No Liability for Third-Party Content  
While we act expeditiously on valid notices, TeacherBuddy disclaims liability for user inputs or AI-generated outputs not affirmatively endorsed by us. Users remain solely responsible for their use of the platform.

For urgent legal notices (e.g., DMCA takedown requests), please label your email accordingly and include all elements required under applicable law.
